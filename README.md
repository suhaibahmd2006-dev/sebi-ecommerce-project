## ✨ Features Implemented

* **🛒 Persistent Shopping Cart:** Utilizes **LocalStorage** to store and retrieve cart data, ensuring items, quantities, and subtotals remain consistent across page navigations and browser restarts.
* **🧩 Centralized Logic:** Core cart management functions (`loadCart`, `updateCartCount`) are abstracted into a centralized `utility.js` file, demonstrating clean architecture and code reusability.
* **📄 Dynamic Product Rendering:** Products are fetched from a local **`Products.json`** file and dynamically rendered onto the Home and Shop pages using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
* **🖼️ Product Detail Page:** Features dynamic image switching, size selection validation, and adds selected product variants to the cart.
* **📱 Fully Responsive Design:** The entire layout is adapted for optimal viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices (CSS media queries).
